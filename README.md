## Overview

This project implements a Tree-sitter parser for Pluto.

## Installation and Setup

To start, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed, as Tree-sitter uses npm for setup. Youâ€™ll also need the Tree-sitter CLI tool, which can be installed via npm.

### Step 1: Install Node.js and npm

Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), which includes npm.

### Step 2: Install Tree-sitter CLI

Install the Tree-sitter CLI globally:
```bash
npm install -g tree-sitter-cli
```


### Step 3: Create the Project Directory

Create a new directory for the Tree-sitter parser:

```bash
mkdir tree-sitter-pluto
cd tree-sitter-pluto
```

### Step 4: Initialize the Tree-sitter Project

Run the following command to initialize your Tree-sitter project. This creates a grammar.js file and package.json:

```bash
tree-sitter init
```

### Step 5: Updating grammar.js with Pluto Grammar

The grammar for Pluto can be derived from Pluto language official resources.


### Step 6: Running Tree-sitter Commands

Once `grammar.js` is updated, you can use the following commands to generate, build, and test your parser.

#### Generate the Parser

```bash
tree-sitter generate
```

#### Build the Parser

```bash
tree-sitter build
```

### Step 7: Push to GitHub



## Creating a Zed Extension

To use this Tree-sitter parser in a Zed extension for syntax highlighting and other features, refer to the [pluto project on GitHub](https://github.com/s7g4/pluto).

For more information on creating Zed extensions, refer to the [official Zed documentation](https://zed.dev/docs/extensions).
